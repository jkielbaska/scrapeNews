## URLs

_This section is not up-to-date because I'm working on page design now_

On every subpage there is a header and footer. In the header you can click on scrapeNews to be redirected to home page, menu button to open countries (when you click on country - you are redirected to this country subpage), change view type (block or list) and change language (ENG/PL). In the footer is a clock and when you click on country/[id] subpage footer displays how much articles there displayed.

- home page - You can click on country to be redirected to this country subpage

- country/[id] - articles from this country are displayed. When you are in the block view, every 'card' contains an article image (if provided by api), header, source, date and description (if provided by api). When in list view there is only a title, source and date. Both in block and list there is a 'SEE ARTICLE' button which opens popup to details of article. Popup contains title, authors, link to article and if possible - content scraped from link. If scraping is blocked, there is displayed content from api. If content from api is null, apoligize message is displayed.
